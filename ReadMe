# Project Name

This project consists of a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- Python (v3.7 or later)
- pip (Python package installer)

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```
   python main.py (for no reload)

   python SourceChangeMonitor.py (for hot reloading)
   ```

   The backend should now be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

In the frontend directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject`: Removes the single build dependency from your project.

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set up any necessary environment variables. The backend uses a `.env` file for configuration.

## Additional Notes

- The frontend uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration can be found in `frontend/tailwind.config.js`.
- WebSocket connection is established on `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws`.
- The backend includes functionality for geocoding, map generation, and chat management.
